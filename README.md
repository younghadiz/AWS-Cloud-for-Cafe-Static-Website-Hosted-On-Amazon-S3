# AWS Cloud Arcfor Cafe-Static-Website-Hosted-On-Amazon-S3
A small café business that sells desserts and coffee. The café has a reputation for high-quality desserts and coffees, but the café's reputation is limited to people who have visited or who have heard about it from other café customers. I suggested that they should expand community awareness of what the café has to offer by having a web presence with a scalable and high availability of the Cafe website on the cloud services.

# Cloud Overview and Objectives on Static Website Hosting

I hosted a static website by using Amazon S3.

I implemented one way to protect the data with Amazon S3.

I implemented a data lifecycle strategy in Amazon S3 for cost effective class storage.

I implemented a disaster recovery (DR) strategy in Amazon S3 by adding versioning and cross region replication.
